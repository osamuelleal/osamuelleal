### Hello guys 👋,


I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from Universidade Internacional Signorelli in Rio de Janeiro in 2021 and currently work in the field of Data Science. I started my studies in the area in the beginning of 2020 through a complete course, where I had the opportunity to develop in the area through the creation of Data Science and Machine Learning projects. Thanks to the knowledge I acquired, it opened doors to enter the data market. Today I worked as a Trainee Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Scientist and Full Stack Bubble Developer at several companies.

</ul>
I am passionate about technology, entrepreneurship and personal development. So, I'm always looking for new ways to improve myself, through books, media and others. I also love making electronic music and playing video games.</ul>
